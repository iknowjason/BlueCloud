# Cost Analysis

## Important Information
As this tool spins up cloud resources, it will result in charges to your Azure or AWS account.  Efforts have been made to minimize the costs incurred, but the tool author is not responsible for any charges or security issues that may result from usage of this tool.  Be sure to tear down all resources when not using them.

## Azure Cost Analysis
Use the Cost Analysis feature of Azure to measure the daily cost of the enabled 
resources.  Here are some approximate figures with standing up a new subscription
and resource group and running BlueCloud Azuure.  The approximate cost is $4.94
after 24 hours, based on the collected sample shown.  The following image shows
the Cost Analysis after the first morning.
